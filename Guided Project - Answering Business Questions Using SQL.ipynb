    "Given that album purchases make up nearly 20% of all invoices, it does not appear to be a good idea to drop the ability to purchase albums from the store. Instead, management should work with the developers to incentivize customers to purchase the full album if they have bought tracks from it. The ability to complete an album purchase has worked well for other online track sales stores like iTunes, and could drive revenue from the other direction."
